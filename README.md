# Java-Control-Flow
1. Control Flow in Java
Controls the execution of code using conditions and loops.
Allows decision-making (if, else, switch) and repetitive execution (loops).

2. Java Boolean Data Type
boolean stores true or false (without quotes).
true and false are reserved keywords, not variable names.
Must be in lowercase (true, false).

3. Boolean Expressions & Logical Operators
Boolean expressions use comparison operators (e.g., ==, !=, >, <).
Logical operators combine multiple conditions (&&, ||, !).

4. Conditional Statements
if Statement → Executes a block if a condition is true.
if-else Statement → Provides an alternative block if the condition is false
else if Clause → Allows multiple conditions.

5.Loops in Java
while Loop → Repeats as long as the condition is true
for Loop → A finite loop with initialization, condition, and update
Infinite Loop → Occurs if the condition never becomes false

6. Loop Control Statements
break → Immediately exits the loop.
continue → Skips the current iteration and moves to the next.

7. Java switch Statement
Alternative to multiple if-else conditions.
Uses case blocks and requires break to prevent fall-through.
